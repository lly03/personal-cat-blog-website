                        <p>As I reached down to pick up the cat toy, which was essentially a cotton string attached to a rod, in the corner of my eye, I noticed a black cat running towards me in excitement. Turning my head around, I see the black cat kicking her back paws onto the marble floor pushing her body towards the toy that I was holding. As she reaches closer to the toy, her soft front paws suddenly reveal its true nature - sharp and dangerous. In an instance, the black cat lashes her sharp claws onto the cotton strings, pulling it towards her. I fight back and in an attempt, pull the toy back to me. The black cat retaliates. It became a tug of war.</p> 
                        <br/>
                        <p>In an epic battle with the cat and I, I managed to take control of the toy and it finally became in my possession. The black cat stares back at me with her big round eyes. I show no mercy. I turn around and see a fluffy black cat. I try to lure her towards me with the string. Suddenly a black shadow flashes before me. It was the cat that I fought before. She opens her mouth wide and tries to grab the string with her teeth. Foreshadowing her movements, I swing the string upwards. However she notices it, so she launches her entire body and hits the string with her paws. Seeing her determination, I surrender. I ended up playing with her till she got tired. But the moment I pick up the toy again to play with the other cats, she would be there.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>This cat is named Lucky.</p>
