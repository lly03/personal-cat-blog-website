                            <p>Peanut has a very interesting personality. She is adventurous and curious, but she is also very cheeky and easily scared. Whenever I do something in the house, like unpacking my weekly groceries or cleaning up the litter box, she would be the first one to appear and start sniffing around wondering what you are doing. In the mornings, she would be very energetic while sprinting around the house to remove that excess energy off her. Because she is a morning cat, we would open the windows letting her sit on the window sill as she watches the bird fly about. She really enjoys the fresh air and nature.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Peanut is also a scaredy cat. A little sudden noise and you’ll see Peanut flinching. During the storms, Peanut becomes more anxious and terrified, she would be the first to sense it and immediately hide under the bed.</p> 
                            <br/>
                            <p>Her cheeky side is something that you shouldn’t underestimate, because she can get you. If you mind your own business, Peanut could sneakily attack your feet and as you turn around to your perpetrator, you’ll see a small calico cat walking away like she has won the game.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Despite everything she is still an adorable cat and will be cherished dearly by me and my family.</p>
