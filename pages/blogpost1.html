                            <p>I got three cats in total. One female calico cat, named <q>Peanut</q>, one female short-haired black cat, named <q>Lucky</q> and one female long-haired black cat, named <q>Fluffy</q>.</p>
                            <br/>    
                            <p> Lucky and Fluffy are sisters. They recently entered into the family, which has caused Peanut to feel very uncomfortable with the new members. As Peanut was the only cat in the house, having two extra new family members was very intimidating. Because with more cats, it would mean less food, less play time and less space in the house. Hence the reason why Peanut would attempt to sneak attack the other cats.</p> 
                            <br/> 
                            <p>However, due to Peanutâ€™s cowardly nature, she failed miserably. Like the time when she tried scaring Lucky, while she was doing her business, Peanut would slowly creep towards her midway then chicken out afterwards. In turn, Peanut, who was once the leader in the house, has now turned into a follower, but still rebels once in a while. Lucky, on the other hand, is now the dominant cat in the house, getting whatever she wants. Fluffy just does not care.</p>
