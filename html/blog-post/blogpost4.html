                            <p>Fluffy couldn't care less about you, unless you are my dad. Her only goals in life are eating, sleeping and hanging out with my dad. Whenever my mum and I try to approach her, she is always cautious.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p><q>Why is this human going near me?</q></p> 
                            <br/>
                            <p><q>GO AWAY! I don’t like you!</q></p> 
                            <br/>
                            <p>As a result, you would often see her run away with her short legs and her fluffy fur coat bouncing about. When she reaches a safe distance, she would give you a deathly stare watching you from every moment.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The only time that she’s friendly with you, is when it’s food time. When I distribute the food in the bowls, Fluffy would come running towards me hoping to get her share of the food. Whenever there are leftovers from the other cats, she will be the first one to finish it all up.</p> 
                            <br/>
                            <p>My dad is Fluffy’s favourite person. Whenever he goes, she would follow. If he’s in the bathroom, she’ll be sitting there waiting for him to finish up. In fact, my dad has a specific sitting area and she would often wait for him to sit there by her. She’s so comfortable with him that she would doze off while drooling on my dad’s pants, which he has to constantly change out of.
                            I feel like Fluffy is the happiest with my dad and that my dad cares for her very much. Even though she is uneasy around me and my mum, I hope that she will open up a bit with me one day like her and my dad.</p>
